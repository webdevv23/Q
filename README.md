# Q Project

This repository contains code for multiple tasks related to a movie-related website development project.

## Task 1: Create a Login Page

A new template page file named `login.php` was created, located at `wp-content/themes/movies/template-parts`. For this task, AJAX was utilized to send a POST request to an endpoint.

## Task 2: Developing a Movies Plugin
 
Focused on creating a WordPress plugin titled "Movies". The plugin introduced a custom post type named "movie" to manage movie-related content. Additionally, a meta box was integrated to facilitate input and display of movie titles within the post editor interface.

## Advanced Task: Gutenberg Block Plugin

Generated a Gutenberg block plugin named "Favorite movie quote", located at `wp-content/plugins/favorite-movie-quote`. This plugin is dynamic.
